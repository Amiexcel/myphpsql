April is the cruellest month, breeding
Lilac out of the dead land , mixing
Memory and desire, stirring
Dull roots with spring rain.
Winter gave us warm, convering
Earth in forgetful snow
, feeding
A little life with dried tubers.
Summer surprised us, coming over the Stanbergersee
With a shower of rain; we stopped in Colonnade,
And went on in sunlight, into the Hofgarten,
And drank coffee and talked for an hour.
Bin gar keine Russin, stamn' aus Litauen, echt deutsh.
And when we were children, staying at the archduke's,
My cousin's, he took me out on a sled,
And i was frightened. He said, Marie,
Marie, hold on tight. And down we went.
In the mountains, there you feel free.
What are the roots that clutch, what branches grow
Out of this stony.
